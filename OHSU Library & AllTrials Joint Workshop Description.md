### **July 25, 2017**

**10-12:30pm**

### **4248 Sam Jackson Hall, Oregon Health & Science University**

Learn how to use Drugs@FDA, how to take steps to improve the transparency of your research, and how to get involved with open science at OHSU. This free, hands-on, practical workshop will introduce tools and resources for advancing research transparency. The workshop will finish with an hour to explore, collaborate, and ask follow-up questions. Join us for the entire workshop or just drop into one session. 

**10-11am**

### **How to access & use public clinical trial information from the FDA**

Clinical trials are the foundation of evidence-based medicine, innovative research, and effective health policy. Information about clinical trials, like that contained in Food and Drug Administration drug approval packages, can help answer medical, research, or policy questions. **Dr. Erick Turner** will illustrate the value of this information and how researchers can access and use it.

### **11-11:30am**

### **How to make your clinical research more transparent through registration and better reporting**

About half of clinical trials have not been publicly registered and reported. Unreported trials undermine both medicine and medical research. **April Clyburne-Sherin** will describe the current state of clinical trial reporting in the U.S., including relevant policies. She will outline concrete steps for investigators to increase transparency in their research and introduce strategies and resources for overcoming transparency barriers.

### **How to access OHSU resources & support for research transparency**

Resources & support to lower the barriers to transparency for researchers are available through the OHSU Library and other organizations on campus. Learn about resources that are relevant to you, and how to increase the impact of your research from **Robin Champieux**. Learn about upcoming open science events and initiatives at OHSU from **Daniela Saderi**.

**11:30-12:30pm Clinical Trial Transparency Drop-In and Coworking Time**

**Audience:** Everyone is welcome. The workshop will be of particular interest to those involved with or interested in clinical research.
