# Clinical Trial Transparency Workshop 
## How to access and use public clinical trial information from the FDA
### Dr. Erick Turner (OHSU)
Clinical trials are the foundation of evidence-based medicine, innovative research, and effective health policy. Public information about clinical trials, such as drug approval packages submitted to and made available by the Food and Drug Administration, can help answer medical, research, or policy questions. Dr. Erick Turner will illustrate the value of this information and how researchers can access and use it. 
## How to make your clinical research more transparent through registration and better reporting
### April Clyburne-Sherin (AllTrials USA)
About half of clinical trials run globally have been publicly registered and reported. Unreported trials undermine both medicine and health research. April Clyburne-Sherin will describe the current state of clinical trial reporting in the US, including relevant policies. She will outline concrete steps for investigators to increase transparency in their research and introduce strategies and resources for overcoming transparency barriers.

### Instructor bios
 
Dr. Erick Turner’s work is aimed at increasing medical research transparency to make the evidence base more complete, truthful, and reliable. He previously worked as an NIH intramural researcher, then as an FDA reviewer, i.e. gatekeeper for drugs new to the US market. There he witnessed how much data never sees the light of day in journal articles.  Motivated by his FDA experience, Dr. Turner and co-authors have published articles re-examining the efficacy of various psychotropic drug classes, the best known of these being a paper published a January 2008 article in the New England Journal of Medicine entitled “Selective Publication of Antidepressant Trials and Its Influence on Apparent Efficacy”. This article received wide coverage in the national and international press and was ranked the 10th most highly cited scientific article in 2008 and, as of the end of 2015, has been cited by over 1000 peer-reviewed journal publications and 700 books.

April Clyburne-Sherin is an Epidemiologist and Methodologist working to advance research transparency through advocacy and training. While at The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Canada, she received her MS in Population Medicine (Epidemiology) and created guidelines to improve pediatric clinical research reporting. During that time, she also co-founded OOO Canada, a network to promote leadership in open access, open education, and open data. Her volunteer work in the open science community brought her to a new opportunity stateside as the Reproducible Research Evangelist at the Center for Open Science, where she conducted workshops for scientists and students. Now focusing on her area of expertise, clinical research transparency, she is the Campaign Manager for AllTrials USA at Sense About Science USA.
