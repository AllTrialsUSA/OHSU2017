# OHSU2017

# Clinical Trial Transparency Workshop 

### **July 25, 2017**

**10-12:30pm**

### **4248 Sam Jackson Hall, Oregon Health & Science University**

### Cost: FREE 

### [RSVP here as spaces are limited](https://goo.gl/forms/TYstSbNUsYH3MTrr2).

Learn how to use Drugs@FDA, how to take steps to improve the transparency of your research, and how to get involved with open science at OHSU. This free, hands-on, practical workshop will introduce tools and resources for advancing research transparency. The workshop will finish with an hour to explore, collaborate, and ask follow-up questions. Join us for the entire workshop or just drop into one session. 

**10-11am**

### **How to access & use public clinical trial information from the FDA**

Clinical trials are the foundation of evidence-based medicine, innovative research, and effective health policy. Information about clinical trials, like that contained in Food and Drug Administration drug approval packages, can help answer medical, research, or policy questions. **Dr. Erick Turner** will illustrate the value of this information and how researchers can access and use it.

### **11-11:30am**

### **How to make your clinical research more transparent through registration and better reporting**

About half of clinical trials have not been publicly registered and reported. Unreported trials undermine both medicine and medical research. **April Clyburne-Sherin** will describe the current state of clinical trial reporting in the U.S., including relevant policies. She will outline concrete steps for investigators to increase transparency in their research and introduce strategies and resources for overcoming transparency barriers.

### **How to access OHSU resources & support for research transparency**

Resources & support to lower the barriers to transparency for researchers are available through the OHSU Library and other organizations on campus. Learn about resources that are relevant to you, and how to increase the impact of your research from **Robin Champieux**. Learn about upcoming open science events and initiatives at OHSU from **Daniela Saderi**.

**11:30-12:30pm Clinical Trial Transparency Drop-In and Coworking Time**

**Audience:** Everyone is welcome. The workshop will be of particular interest to those involved with or interested in clinical research.

### Instructor bios
 
Dr. Erick Turner’s work is aimed at increasing medical research transparency to make the evidence base more complete, truthful, and reliable. He previously worked as an NIH intramural researcher, then as an FDA reviewer, i.e. gatekeeper for drugs new to the US market. There he witnessed how much data never sees the light of day in journal articles.  Motivated by his FDA experience, Dr. Turner and co-authors have published articles re-examining the efficacy of various psychotropic drug classes, the best known of these being a paper published a January 2008 article in the New England Journal of Medicine entitled “Selective Publication of Antidepressant Trials and Its Influence on Apparent Efficacy”. This article received wide coverage in the national and international press and was ranked the 10th most highly cited scientific article in 2008 and, as of the end of 2015, has been cited by over 1000 peer-reviewed journal publications and 700 books.

April Clyburne-Sherin is an Epidemiologist and Methodologist working to advance research transparency through advocacy and training. While at The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Canada, she received her MS in Population Medicine (Epidemiology) and created guidelines to improve pediatric clinical research reporting. During that time, she also co-founded OOO Canada, a network to promote leadership in open access, open education, and open data. Her volunteer work in the open science community brought her to a new opportunity stateside as the Reproducible Research Evangelist at the Center for Open Science, where she conducted workshops for scientists and students. Now focusing on her area of expertise, clinical research transparency, she is the Campaign Manager for AllTrials USA at Sense About Science USA.
